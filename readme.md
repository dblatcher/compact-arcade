# Compact Arcade
Ever wanted to add a canvas game to a webpage that will fit neatly into one element and not clutter your nameSpace? Want to get straight into writing an object-oriented game without having to build it from scratch?
That's what this is for!
The project aims to provide a flexible template for writing 2d arcade games as a single javaScript object that can be used as a scaffold for developers to quickly build games to order. With the scaffold in place, the developer can focus on defining the game world, the things  that populate it and how they behave and interact.

# Current features
* working example with a sample platform game (keyboard input only)
